# Smart_Traffic_Signal-SIH-Project
This model uses motion detection technology through image processing which is more feasible, consistent and requires lesser resources. This technology detects moving objects rather than classifying them. This is calibrated in such a way that moving objects which are smaller than a threshold value are considered to be noises. In order to efficiently use the signal timer, this model comes up with a dynamically adjustable timer which is based on number of moving vehicles and a signal sequence is determined by descending order of vehicle intensities in the respective lanes.
